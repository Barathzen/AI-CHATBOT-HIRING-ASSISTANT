### Notes
- **Gemini API**: Ensure you have a valid API key from Google Cloud. Replace `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.
- **Data Privacy**: This demo stores data in memory (session state). For production, use a secure database and implement GDPR-compliant practices.
- **Deployment**: For a cloud demo, consider AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google Cloud Run. Provide a live link if deployed.

This implementation meets all requirements and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements! Let me know if you need help with deployment or additional features.
